# All-submission benchmark results

For the 9 October io_uring revision and native x86-64 comparisons, see [IO_URING.md](IO_URING.md). The results below describe earlier epoll revisions.

Measured on 6 October 2026 on an Apple M1 Pro, using native Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 in Docker Desktop. Every server stack had one CPU, 2 GiB RAM and no container swap; the load generator ran on separate CPUs. The initial table uses Rust revision `7b8c351` and the 13 submission pull requests available when the manifest was recorded (#1–14). Newer submissions #15–18 are not included. Later Rust optimizations are measured separately below. These are local throughput results, not official x86-64 DigitalOcean/k6 capacity scores.

## Throughput

Requests/second, median of three 15-second trials per workload, with two-second warmup, 64 keep-alive connections, fresh verified seed copies and varied execution order. Sorted by mixed throughput; each workload also has its own ranking.

| Implementation | Feed req/s | Post req/s | Mixed req/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Rust / synchronous epoll | 65,949 | 329,496 | 90,893 |

## Leaders and differences

- Feed: Rust / synchronous epoll leads. Rust is +44.1% versus the fastest existing submission, C++ / epoll v2 #9.
- Post: Rust / synchronous epoll leads. Rust is +21.4% versus the fastest existing submission, C++ / epoll v2 #9.
- Mixed: Rust / synchronous epoll leads. Rust is +40.9% versus the fastest existing submission, C++ / epoll v2 #9.

Across these observed trials, even Rust's slowest result exceeded every baseline's fastest result on the same workload:

- Feed: +31.0% (Rust minimum 63,277; best baseline maximum 48,287 requests/s).
- Post: +19.6% (Rust minimum 325,645; best baseline maximum 272,244 requests/s).
- Mixed: +25.4% (Rust minimum 88,452; best baseline maximum 70,563 requests/s).

## Additional mixed comparison

One C++/epoll v2 mixed run in the full batch dropped to 53,059 requests/s with a 292.391 ms p99, versus 70,563 requests/s and 4.566 ms p99 in its first run. Several later feed measurements were also lower. The cause was not established. To check the mixed gain over shorter elapsed time, a separate three-trial comparison ran Rust and the three fastest existing native competitors after the full batch, with the same fresh seeds, resource limits, workload, warmup and 15-second measurement.

| Implementation | Median req/s | Min–max req/s | Median p95 / p99 ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Rust / synchronous epoll | 90,249 | 89,935–90,551 | 2.937 / 5.950 |
| C++ / epoll v2 #9 | 71,004 | 69,461–71,191 | 2.327 / 4.667 |
| C++ / uWebSockets #6 | 67,462 | 66,114–67,595 | 2.239 / 4.451 |
| C / fio-stl #5 | 62,183 | 46,968–62,463 | 2.896 / 5.594 |

Rust leads this follow-up by **27.1%** over C++ / epoll v2 #9. All 12 measured runs and warmups had zero errors; all four repeated official checks passed 42/42. Binaries were identical between the two batches. The full batch's mixed median gain is 40.9%; this shorter follow-up provides a separate estimate that avoids relying on the full batch's large baseline latency spike. Raw evidence is in [`bench/confirmatory-mixed.json.gz`](bench/confirmatory-mixed.json.gz).


## Latency and memory

p95/p99 are median run percentiles in milliseconds. Memory is the median from mixed runs. Summed process RSS includes the launcher and may double-count shared pages. Peak cgroup memory includes startup, seed copying, page cache and kernel memory.

## Correctness and integrity

All 14 implementations passed 42/42 official API checks before the final batch. The batch contains 126 measured runs.

Every final measured run and warmup reported zero socket errors/timeouts, zero HTTP errors and zero mixed-workload semantic errors.

The official seed row-content hash was verified. Application source and build flags are unchanged. The Bun installer was adapted only to select the checksum-pinned official ARM64 asset of the same runtime version. Rails uses its declared Nginx deployment; Nginx and Rails share one resource-limited cgroup. Pinned Ruby and Erlang runtimes were compiled once and reused.

Raw measured/warmup output, validation output, source references, binary hashes, compiler/runtime versions, CPU usage and per-process memory appear in [`bench/results.json.gz`](bench/results.json.gz). Only completed final batches are included here. Aborted setup runs contributed no rows. No builds ran during final measurements.

## Limits and reproduction

This establishes a ranking for the listed workloads at 64 connections on this ARM64 machine. It does not establish the official x86-64 score, performance with 15,000 active users, five-minute sustained capacity, or behaviour over a real network. The official load test has think time and different concurrency, so its ranking may differ. Three short trials provide limited evidence about variance and long-running write/checkpoint behaviour. Each implementation retains its own SQLite version and settings, so these results compare complete submissions rather than programming languages in isolation.

See [bench/README.md](bench/README.md) for the method and reproduction commands. [bench/manifest.json](bench/manifest.json) pins every baseline commit.

## Later allocation improvements

Revision `fbdbe2b` fixes malformed like routes and `Expect: 100-continue` handling. Revision `2f6000c` adds reusable JWT buffers, borrowed username/body parsing, prepared transaction statements, and insert-plus-timestamp lookup in place of `INSERT ... RETURNING`. It preserves full JSON/Unicode validation and commit-before-response behavior.

A thread-local Rust allocator counter around HTTP parsing, serving, commit and checkpoint work observed seven allocation/reallocation calls per ordinary create and four per like before the changes, and zero afterward. Each route was warmed twice and measured for 100 calls. Reads were already zero. SQLite's C allocator and socket I/O are outside this counter; escaped strings, chunked bodies, partial requests, backpressure and capacity growth can still allocate. The checked-in ignored allocation test asserts zero for ordinary warmed handlers.

The first 30-run comparison of buffer/transaction changes measured median gains of 7.5% for creates, 5.2% for likes, 2.6% for feeds, 0.5% for post reads and 0.8% for mixed traffic. Paired read/mixed results changed direction and their ranges overlapped, so this does not establish a read/mixed improvement. A separate four-run probe found 6.7% more creates/s after removing the temporary `RETURNING` result table, with mixed traffic unchanged.

The final three-trial confirmation compared the complete candidate directly against `fbdbe2b`, under the same one-CPU/2-GiB limits, 64 connections, fresh seeds, two-second warmups and 15-second measurements:

| Workload | Before req/s | After req/s | Median gain | Before min–max | After min–max | Before / after median p99 ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Creates | 57,680 | 61,238 | +6.2% | 56,789–60,228 | 53,860–63,136 | 6.790 / 8.303 |
| Likes | 176,239 | 179,911 | +2.1% | 169,161–176,652 | 179,667–180,810 | 0.764 / 0.717 |
| Mixed | 90,383 | 90,361 | −0.02% | 88,270–91,476 | 89,237–92,343 | 4.618 / 4.561 |

Creates use real ASCII posts; likes target seed post 500000 with random seed users, so many likes are duplicates after warmup. Mixed uses live feed IDs. The create/mixed ranges overlap. One candidate create run had a **932.332 ms p99** spike and lower throughput; its other two p99s were 8.303 and 6.697 ms. The cause was not established. These results support modest write-throughput gains, not consistent tail-latency gains or an improved official capacity score.

All 52 measured runs and warmups across the three stages reported zero errors. Both versions passed 42/42 official checks in the final batch. The final candidate separately passed 77 additional checks, SIGKILL recovery, 15,000 health-validated connections and 66-second reuse, the allocation assertion, and an x86-64 source/C-binding cross-check. Final idle RSS was 10.06 MiB.

Raw runs, warmups, validation logs, runner source, source hashes and binary hashes are in [`bench/optimization-results.json.gz`](bench/optimization-results.json.gz). See [bench/README.md](bench/README.md) to reproduce the revision comparison. The original all-submission table remains evidence for the initial version; the final candidate was not rerun against every language submission.

## Official JavaScript workload locally

Ran the repository's **unmodified `bench/load.js`** with checksum-verified k6 2.3.0 ARM64. Each revision started from a fresh seed, passed 42/42 API checks, completed the prescribed 1,000-user/two-minute warmup, then kept the same server/database for a **2,500-user/five-minute hold**. Both runs used the script's default 60-second ramp-up and 30-second ramp-down, original think times, write probabilities and thresholds.

| Revision | Users held | p95 ms | p99 ms | Failed requests | Requests | Average req/s | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Before allocations (`fbdbe2b`) | 2,500 | 2.827 | 7.949 | 0% | 93,366 | 233.4 | Pass |
| Current (`b79f11f`) | 2,500 | 2.456 | 7.736 | 0% | 93,546 | 233.9 | Pass |

All request checks passed in both holds and both warmups. k6 summaries and threshold decisions include ramp-up/down and graceful stopping; these percentiles are the full-run summaries, not separately filtered steady-hold measurements. Requests/s is workload-paced by think time and is not maximum throughput.

Server limits: one CPU, 2 GiB without swap and 65,535 file descriptors. Client limits: two separate CPUs, 2,800 MiB without swap. HTTP used shared-host Linux loopback, with four loopback source addresses; no OS settings were changed. Both servers and clients stayed within their limits, with no OOMs. All builds finished before timing.

This establishes **both revisions pass 2,500 users locally**. There was one hold per revision; it does not establish a speedup, maximum capacity, or the official x86-64 DigitalOcean score. That revision comparison did not search for the user limit; a later search follows below. The official score still requires its separate load-generator machine and server.

Raw k6 summaries/logs, sampled server/client resource counters, source/binary identities, script checksum, preparation and runner source are in [`bench/official-k6-results.json.gz`](bench/official-k6-results.json.gz).

## Official workload capacity search

Application revision `230b2f8` was unchanged throughout the search. The unmodified official script and k6 2.3.0 retain the 60-second ramp, five-minute hold, 30-second ramp-down, think times, probabilities and thresholds. Each search kept the same server/database running after the 1,000-user/two-minute warmup. Percentiles and failure rates are the full-run k6 summaries, including ramps and graceful stopping.

The **M1/Docker ARM64 server passed 40,000 users**, with zero failures and p95/p99 **154.26/470.04 ms**. The 80,000-user probe was invalid: the Chisel transport was OOM-killed in the 4-GiB Docker VM; Rust remained running without OOM events. A separate 40,000-user repeat was also invalid because the aggregate SSH relay disconnected. These establish a local lower bound, not an M1 capacity ceiling. The transport bypassed Docker published-port forwarding and used 1-KiB buffers and eight loopback origin addresses; its exact patch and identities are included with the evidence.

To remove that transport, the same source was built as an unprivileged user and tested on **native Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64 / Xeon E5-2690 v3**, with Docker host networking. Rust 1.94.0 and GCC 12.2 came from the pinned `rust:1.94.0-bookworm` image. The server had **one CPU, 2 GiB without swap, and 65,535 descriptors**. k6 ran on separate physical cores of that same 64-GiB host, with eight loopback source addresses. This is a different server machine from the M1 comparison and uses same-host loopback, not the official separate-client DigitalOcean setup. No kernel settings or unrelated processes were changed. All builds finished before measurements, and the native server passed **42/42 official API checks** on its fresh seed before warmup.

The search started at the observed 40,000-user lower bound, doubled to a failing 80,000-user probe, then bisected to **250-user resolution** and repeated the highest pass for another five-minute hold:

| Users | Phase | p95 ms | p99 ms | Failed requests | Result |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 40,000 | Search | 0.995 | 21.148 | 0.000% | Pass |
| 80,000 | Search | 2.317 | 22.250 | 4.699% | Fail |

| 65,000 | Search | 9.058 | 26.913 | 0.000% | Pass |
| 67,500 | Search | 2.604 | 22.239 | 0.552% | Pass |
| 68,750 | Search | 2.694 | 22.015 | 0.988% | Pass |
| 69,250 | Search | 2.761 | 22.216 | 1.165% | Fail |
| 69,000 | Search | 2.563 | 22.090 | 1.077% | Fail |
| 68,750 | Confirmation | 2.610 | 22.365 | 0.990% | Pass |

The confirmed benchmark boundary is **68,750 passing / 69,000 failing**. Both 68,750-user holds passed, at **0.988% and 0.990% failures**—very close to the permitted 1%. **65,000 users had zero failures**; that is the highest zero-failure count tested, not a separate search for an exact zero-failure maximum. This is a measured threshold boundary rather than a guarantee across machines or future runs. Requests/s is think-time paced, not maximum throughput, and no C++ capacity comparison was performed.

Above the connection limit, sampled descriptors reached **65,535** and k6 logged feed request timeouts; latency thresholds still passed. The application remained running throughout, with zero cgroup OOM events and a **340.27 MiB peak**. The host retained at least **31.71 GiB of available memory** during the generator samples. The current connection table is also bounded at 65,536 entries. These results identify the descriptor/connection cap as the constraint in this configuration; they do not establish the CPU or memory ceiling after lifting it.

Raw summaries/logs, resource samples, validation, source/binary/script/image hashes, transport patch and exact runner/preparation scripts are in [`bench/official-k6-capacity-results.json.gz`](bench/official-k6-capacity-results.json.gz). Invalid transport attempts are explicitly marked and excluded from the native bracket.

## Raised descriptor capacity

On 7 October 2026, the native x86-64 search was repeated with the `f631fff` source plus the descriptor patch: startup raises only its own soft `RLIMIT_NOFILE` within the inherited hard limit, the ceiling is 1,048,576, and the table grows from at most 4,096 slots. The server inherited soft/hard limits of 1,024/1,048,576 and raised the soft limit to 1,048,576. This is an experimental source snapshot, **not the submitted implementation**. Its descriptor patch was not retained because later throughput comparisons did not satisfy the no-regression requirement. The inherited own-thread affinity is also removed from the submitted source under rule 11.

The same Xeon host, server CPU 23, one CPU quota and 2-GiB/no-swap budget were used. The unchanged official k6 script retained its warmup, 60-second ramp, five-minute holds, 30-second ramp-down and thresholds. The database evolved throughout the search. k6 used other physical cores, 16 loopback source addresses, a 48-GiB/no-swap cap, `GOGC=50` and `GOMEMLIMIT=44GiB`. Full-run summaries include ramps and graceful stopping.

| 189,500 | Confirmation | 462.805 | 675.953 | 0.120% | Pass |

The confirmation pass was **189,500 users**, with p95/p99 **462.805/675.953 ms** and **0.120% failures**. The 189,750 confirmation failed. Although 190,000 passed during search, it failed confirmation; the apparent 250-user boundary is sensitive to variation. The highest zero-failure count tested was **160,000**, not an exact zero-failure maximum. This is 2.76 times the old descriptor-constrained confirmation count, not a requests/s speedup or an official droplet score. No C++ capacity comparison was run.

**The generator constrains this result.** The 320,000-user attempt was OOM-killed by its client memory cap and is excluded. At high counts k6 approaches its 44-GiB Go memory limit and consumes many CPU cores. Server throughput fell between 160,000 and 240,000 users while sampled server CPU usage also fell; the app remained healthy. Tiny independent read probes often stayed fast, but cannot establish write tail latency. These observations do not isolate Rust's CPU ceiling. Subsequent CPU/heap profiles inspect this pressure separately.

The server stayed within its 2-GiB budget without OOMs; its lifetime cgroup memory peak was **1,162.64 MiB**, including file cache and kernel socket memory. This is different from process RSS. Builds ran as UID 1000 before timing. The native version passed 42/42 official checks, 77 additional checks, SIGKILL recovery, and 80,000 simultaneous health-validated connections with one-second reuse. The earlier 66-second reuse result belongs to the ARM64 validation. No kernel settings changed.

## Memory and scoring follow-up (7 October 2026)

The experimental candidate removes application CPU affinity, initializes descriptor storage only as needed, and uses 64-byte function alignment on x86-64. **This candidate was rejected after its longer mixed confirmation regressed.** The submitted follow-up only removes CPU affinity to comply with rule 11. SQL, data, indexes, durability, per-request authentication and dependencies are unchanged. Compared with published revision `f631fff`, each workload below used three alternating 30-second trials, 64 connections, a fresh seed and two seconds of warmup. Server: one CPU, 2 GiB, no swap; client: separate CPUs. These comparisons rerun our prior version, not every submission.

| Workload | ARM64 published → candidate req/s | Change | Xeon published → candidate req/s | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Feed | 54,265 → 58,865 | +8.48% | 27,320 → 27,753 | +1.58% |
| Post | 234,098 → 253,953 | +8.48% | 95,252 → 96,955 | +1.79% |
| Mixed | 75,997 → 77,854 | +2.44% | 31,749 → 31,651 | -0.31% |
| Create | 51,782 → 54,758 | +5.75% | 9,157 → 9,321 | +1.79% |
| Like | 154,054 → 164,668 | +6.89% | 72,187 → 73,384 | +1.66% |

Trial ranges and raw paired observations are included in `bench/score-profile-results.json.gz`. ARM64 mixed ranges were 73,230–84,173 versus 69,908–84,796 req/s; Xeon mixed ranges were 26,229–31,769 versus 26,387–33,291. Run-to-run variation prevents a literal guarantee of never losing one request/s. The longer five-pair, 45-second mixed confirmation measured **27,364.93 → 26,909.97 req/s (−1.66%)**. Published range: 26,631.68–33,742.12; candidate range: 26,173.19–29,578.65. This rejected the candidate despite the earlier gains. No final-source capacity confirmation was run for it.

Mixed median process RSS fell from 46.809 to 44.266 MiB on ARM64 and 36.742 to 31.961 MiB on Xeon. Anonymous memory fell from 9.520 to 6.516 MiB and 7.672 to 2.738 MiB respectively. Native cgroup memory fell from 21.512 to 16.762 MiB, but seed copies outside that cgroup can charge file cache to the host. These figures exclude whole-host memory and cannot be substituted for droplet measurements.

Issue #7's unofficial table uses 40% mixed throughput, 20% physical application lines, 20% resolved production dependencies and 20% RSS. The rejected candidate would reduce application lines from 1,357 to 1,309, projecting approximately 76.2 versus 75.5 while holding the issue's M2 throughput/RSS figures fixed. **That candidate is not submitted.** The minimal rules fix has 1,329 lines, giving a code-only projection of approximately **75.9**, with dependencies unchanged at 25 including SQLite. Neither projection is a measured table score or ranking. The official challenge score remains the five-minute k6 capacity threshold. The table author must rerun submitted source on their machine.

### Retained rules-only patch

After rejecting the memory candidate, a minimal patch removed affinity without changing handler/SQLite code, connection storage or compiler flags. A separate three-pair 30-second Xeon comparison passed 42/42 official checks for both builds and had no warmup or measurement errors. Feed median: **27,322.14 → 27,623.92 req/s (+1.10%)**; ranges 26,958.52–27,794.99 versus 27,443.94–27,772.49. Mixed median: **28,939.06 → 32,321.19 req/s (+11.69%)**; ranges 28,278.65–29,550.92 versus 26,867.77–33,870.42. Mixed variation is substantial, including one slower candidate run; these measurements do not prove a causal 11.69% gain or guarantee every run improves. Only feed/mixed were remeasured for this minimal patch.

No memory reduction is claimed for the retained patch: mixed RSS medians were 36.434 versus 36.883 MiB, anonymous memory 7.668 versus 7.660 MiB. Source/binary identities, raw observations and validation are in the evidence archive. Its native validation passes 82 additional checks, SIGKILL recovery and 15,000 simultaneous health-checked connections with 66-second original-socket reuse. The lower-memory candidate's 80,000-connection result does not describe this retained 65,536-slot implementation.
